# Configuration management

In this project, I started working with Puppet as a configuration management tool. I practiced writing Puppet manifest files to create a file, install a package, and execute a command.

## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

**0. Create a file** <br>
*0-create_a_file.pp:* Puppet manifest file that creates a file `holberton` in the `/tmp` directory. <br>
_File permissions_: `0744`. <br>
_File group_: `www-data`. <br>
_File owner_: www-data. <br>
_File content_: `I love Puppet`. <br>

**1. Install a package** <br>
*1-install_a_package.pp:* Puppet manifest file that install puppet-lint version 2.1.1.

**2. Execute a command** <br>
*2-execute_a_command.pp:* Puppet manifest file that kills the process `killmenow`.
