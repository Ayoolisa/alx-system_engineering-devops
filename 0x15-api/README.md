# API

This project was further practice in working with API's. I collected data from the [JSONPlaceholder REST API](JSONPlaceholder REST API), and learned how to export it to either CSV or JSON format.

## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

# 0.Gather data from an API
- [0-gather_data_from_an_API.py](0-gather_data_from_an_API.py): Python script that returns information on the to-do list progress of a given employee ID.

- Usage: `python3 0-gather_data_from_an_API.py <employee ID>`.
- Output: `Employee <employee name> is done with tasks(<# completed tasks>/<total # tasks>):`
